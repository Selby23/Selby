      <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
      <h3>Goal and Mission</h3>
    <p style="font-family:courier;">Our vision at Mzamomtsha Primary School is to empower students <br> to acquire, demonstrate, articulate and value knowledge and skills <br>
       that will support them, as life-long learners, to participate in <br>
       and contribute to the global world and practice the core values <br>
       of the school: respect, tolerance & inclusion, and excellence. <br>
       Our mission is to develop students with active and creative minds, <br>
       a sense of understanding and compassion for others, and the courage <br>
       to act on their beliefs. We stress the total development of each <br>
       child: spiritual, moral, intellectual, social, emotional, and physical.
